## Unreleased

## 1.3.0 (2024-01-07)

* Add [`same_network_verdict` option](https://dfw.rs/latest/dfw/types/struct.ContainerToContainer.html#structfield.same_network_verdict) to container-to-container configuration, enabling users to specify whether traffic between containers within the same network should be allowed or not.
* Replace library used to communicate with Docker (which also fixes [#411]).

    This release replaces the previously used library [shiplift] by [bollard].
    This is not expected to have any impact on users of DFW.

    [#411]: https://github.com/pitkley/dfw/issues/411
    [shiplift]: https://github.com/softprops/shiplift
    [bollard]: https://github.com/fussybeaver/bollard

* Build Docker images for multiple architectures: `amd64`, `arm64`, `arm/v7`.

    This is especially helpful for Raspberry Pi users, as they can now use the official Docker image instead of having to build the binary themselves.

    You can pull the image from Docker Hub (`pitkley/dfw:1.3.0`) or the GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/pitkley/dfw:1.3.0`) for any of the mentioned architectures.

<sub>Internal changes: dependency updates, CI updates, bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.67.0 (from 1.46.0), bump to Rust edition 2021.</sub>

## 1.2.1 (2020-12-13)

* Fix incorrect handling of host-ports in wider-world-to-container rules.

## 1.2.0 (2020-07-13)

* Reintegrate the iptables-backend.

    This reintroduces an iptables-based firewall-backend (v1.0 initially dropped iptables-support), specifically the iptables-restore backend that was made available in v0.4+.

    The backend can be selected through the `--firewall-backend iptables` CLI parameter (`nftables` is the default).

* Make exposing containers via IPv6 configurable.

    You can now specify the `expose_via_ipv6`-key within a wider-world-to-container-rule to configure whether the service should be exposed via IPv6 or not (the default is `true`).

    _(Please note that further requirements need to be fulfilled such that exposing services via IPv6 to works, [see here](https://github.com/pitkley/dfw/blob/main/README.md#ipv6support).)_

* Ensure consistent behaviour regardless of whether `[global_defaults]` has been specified or not.

    Previously DFW showed different behaviour depending on whether `global_defaults` was specified or not, regardless of the actual content within the section (which was allowed to be empty).
    This release ensures that the same behaviour is maintained no matter if the section was defined or not.

* Don't exit DFW if there are no containers running ([#243](https://github.com/pitkley/dfw/pull/243), thanks to @Georgiy-Tugai).

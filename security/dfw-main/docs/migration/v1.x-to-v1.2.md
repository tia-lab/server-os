# Migrating from DFW v1.x to v1.2

DFW v1.2 reintroduced an iptables-based firewall-backend (v1.0 initially dropped iptables-support), specifically the `iptables-restore` backend that was made available in v0.4+.

If you are upgrading from a previous 1.x-version and:

* **want to switch back to the iptables-backend**:

    Consult the [v0.x to v1.2 upgrade documentation][migration-v0.x-to-v1.2].

* **want to stick with nftables**:

    Follow this document.

## <a name="migratingconfig"></a> Migrating your pre-v1.2 DFW configuration

**All configuration changes** between v1.x and v1.2 **are backwards-compatible**, so you don't *have to* do anything to upgrade to v1.2.
Applying the following steps is still advised though, DFW will print warnings if you use the deprecated fields.

* The top-level key `backend_defaults` has been added.

    Since v1.2 reintroduces the iptables-backend and thus needs to support different configuration-needs for either backend, this new key has been introduced.

    A few of the existing configuration-keys have been moved into this new section, they are described below.

* The `defaults` key has been renamed to `global_defaults`.

    This has been done to avoid any confusion with the new `backend_defaults` key.

* The `initialization` key has been moved to the `backend_defaults` section.

    Since the content of the initialization is strictly backend-dependent, the key has been moved to the new `backend_defaults` section -- and with it its sub-key `rules`.

    **Before:**

    ```toml
    [initialization]
    rules = [
        "add rule inet filter input tcp dport 22 accept"
    ]
    ```

    **After:**

    ```toml
    [backend_defaults]
    [backend_defaults.initialization]
    rules = [
        "add rule inet filter input tcp dport 22 accept"
    ]
    ```

* The `custom_tables` key has been moved to the `backend_defaults` section.

    Since the `custom_tables` key is only relevant to the nftables-backend, it has been moved to the `backend_defaults` section.

    **Before:**

    ```toml
    [defaults]
    custom_tables = { name = "filter", chains = ["input", "forward"] }
    ```

    **After:**

    ```toml
    [backend_defaults]
    custom_tables = { name = "filter", chains = ["input", "forward"] }
    ```

#### Summary example

**Before:**

```toml
[defaults]
external_network_interfaces = "eth0"
custom_tables = { name = "filter", chains = ["input", "forward"] }

[initialization]
rules = [
    "add rule inet filter input tcp dport 22 accept"
]
```

**After:**

```toml
[global_defaults]
external_network_interfaces = "eth0"

[backend_defaults]
custom_tables = { name = "filter", chains = ["input", "forward"] }

[backend_defaults.initialization]
rules = [
    "add rule inet filter input tcp dport 22 accept"
]
```
